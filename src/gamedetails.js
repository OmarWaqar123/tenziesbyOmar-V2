    gameDes : "Tenzies is a fun and addictive dice game that is easy to learn and quick to play. The game involves rolling 10 dice at once and trying to match the same number on all of them, called a 'tenzie'. In your version of the game, instead of dots, the dice have numbers on them. With no multi-player facility, it's just you against the dice, so it's a great way to challenge yourself and improve your skills. Whether you're a seasoned dice player or new to the game, Tenzies is sure to provide hours of entertainment and excitement.",
