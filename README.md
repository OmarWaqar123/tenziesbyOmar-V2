Tenzies is a fun and addictive single player game created using React framework. The objective of the game is simple - roll all ten dice until they show the same number, known as "Tenzies".

As a player, you can roll the dice by clicking on the "Roll" button, and the dice will show random numbers between 1 and 6. You can then choose to hold any dice you want and roll the rest again until all ten dice show the same number.

The game is timed, and you can track your best time in the game. The timer starts when you roll the first dice and stops when all ten dice show the same number. You can also reset the game at any time to start over.

Tenzies is a great way to pass the time and challenge yourself to beat your best time. So why not give it a try and see how fast you can roll all ten dice to get Tenzies?
